C# Sudoku from Prof. Zoran Horvat converted to Rust and Refactored.

Prof. Zoran Horvat (https://github.com/zoran-horvat) created a C# Sudoku program specifically for the purposes of refactoring. "an awfully long method. Try to refactor this method."

During the pandemic I practiced refactoring this code for fun. Gained a lot of experience.

Now I have translated the original unrefactored code from C# to Rust, and subsequently refactored the Rust code.

I plan to do this for other languages as well. Ruby. Go.

I like Rust though. The RustRover IDE is rather nice.
